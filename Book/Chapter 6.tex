\section{Effects at the molecular and cellular level}
The DNA is the most important target for ionising radiation. The DNA can be ionised and damaged (See Chapter 3). DNA can be damaged through a single-strand, double-strand break, base or cluster (damage to closely spaced places, causing debris) damage.\\
Ionising radiation can also damage DNA and tissue through radical formation. Radicals can be formed in water: H and OH. Indirect DNA damage accounts for 2/3 of the damage, while direct damage only accounts for 1/3.\\ 
The cell can repair single-strand damage quite well, but double-strand break reparation often causes even more damage. \\
$\alpha$ radiation causes many ionisations close to each other, so double-strand breaks are common. It has the most harmful effect (x20).

\section{Effects in humans}
It can either be on the individual or on the offspring. On the individual:
\subsection{Stochastic/probabilitstic effects}
Random in nature, always has some probability of ocurring. They have no threshold dose, but the probability increases with increasing dose.\\
Example: cancer

\subsection{Harmful tissue reaction/deterministic/non-stochastic effects}
Takes place when enough cells in an organ have been killed. The dose needed to create an observable effect is the threshold dose. After exceeding the threshold, the severity of the effect increases with an increase of dose.\\ Example: erythrema.

\section{Harmful tissue reactions}
\textbf{The severity of the effect increases with the dose.} If the loss of functionality is not too serious, the recovery process will ensure the organ returns to normal (though it may take a long time and leave scar). If a dose is received over a longer period of time, more in-between recovery will take place and the long-lasting damage will be lower. It may appear immediately or after a latency period. Threshold doses are normally specified for conditions where the dose is received in a short period, with almost no recovery. \\
Threshold doses and latency periods can be seen in Table 6.1.\\\\
For a radiation worker in a diagnostic or research laboratory, the threshold cannot be exceeded, even in an incident, as the activity is too low. In medical applications, there may be damage if carelessness is present, and any threshold dose can be exceeded after an incident. For patients, the risk is greater, especially in radiotherapy. In industrial radiography, any threshold can be exceeded after an accident.

\section{Stochastic effects}
Data has been obtained through epidemiological studies such as: Hiroshima and Nagasaki, medical irradiation, radiation workers, Chernobyl and Fukushima, etc. Approximations* can be derived from that (*however, those approximations only apply to a select population: those healthy enough to survive the high radiation dose). This may underestimate the risk to the random group of all healthy and non-healthy people together; or it could be overestimated, and low doses can't be harmful because we're already used to them. \\
For the determination of risk, a LNT model (linear, no-threshold) is used. It means that a low additional dose also increases the risk of cancer a bit. There is plenty of debate in this topic.\\
The latency period is the period befor the cancer (late effect) becomes manifest. After the latent period, a risk follows. The latency period depends on the cancer type. Leikemia has a short latency period of 2 years, and a maximum risk of 20; lethal tumors have a latency period of 5-10 years, and risk of at least 30 years.<
